# battery-notification2.0
A simple battery notification script

This is an updated script to notify you that your laptop needs to be plugged in.

From [version 1.0](https://github.com/enigmatic-system/battery-notification) I've added 3 levels of notifications...

  - Critical level notification at 10%

  - Normal level notification at 15%

  - Low level notification at 20%

This script works with notify-send and I use Dunst as the notification daemon.

Next I would like to add a "Fully Charged" notification but doing so requires a 1 time notification...

We shall see if it works...
